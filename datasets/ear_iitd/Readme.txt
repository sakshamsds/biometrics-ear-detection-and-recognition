Description of the IIT Delhi Ear Database version 1.0
=======================================================

This touchless ear image database mainly consists of the hand images collected from the students and staff at IIT Delhi, India. This database has been acquired in IIT Delhi campus during Oct 2006 - Jun 2007 using a simple imaging setup. All the images are acquired from a distance (touchless) using simple imaging setup and the imaging is performed in the indoor environment. The currently available database is acquired from the 121 different subjects and each subject has at least three ear images. All the subjects in the database are in the age group 14-58 years. The database of 471 images has been sequentially numbered for every user with an integer identification/number. The resolution of these images is 272 x 204 pixels and all these images are available in jpeg format. In addition to the original images, this database also provide the automatically normalized and cropped ear images of size 50 x 180 pixels. Recently, a larger version of ear database (automatically cropped and normalized) from 212 users with 754 ear images is also integrated and made available on request.

Organization of Database
========================
The acquired database is saved in the folder named 'raw' images. In addition, a new folder 'processed' is also made available. This folder contains automatically segmented and normalized images corresponding to raw images from 125 subjects. Each of the 50 x 180 pixel images is named as 'XXX_Y.bmp., where XXX represents user identification number and Y represents image sample number. Automatically segmented and normalized images from 221 subjects, which also includes the images from 125 subjects, are also available in this folder.
